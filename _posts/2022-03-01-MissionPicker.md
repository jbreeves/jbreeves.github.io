Mission Picker v1 is here!

Do you struggle with an abundance of missions to choose from? Do you have trouble choosing? Let my new python script help you! Just type the mission names into the script and follow the instructions to have it pick your next mission for you.

I created this script to help with choosing between side missions in an RPG.
